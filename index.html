        <h3 id="headline">About Bhagat Singh life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong> - Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the
            Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1919</strong> - when he was 12 years old, Singh visited the
            site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hours after thousands of
            unarmed people gathered at a public meeting had been killed
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1921</strong> - 20 February 1921. Singh became disillusioned
            with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence after he called off
            the non-co-operation movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1923</strong> - Singh joined the National College in Lahore,
            where he also participated in extra-curricular activities like the
            dramatics society. In 1923, he won an essay competition set by the
            Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, writing on the problems in the
            Punjab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926</strong> - he founded the Indian socialist youth
            organisation Naujawan Bharat Sabha in March 1926. He also joined the
            Hindustan Republican Association, which had prominent leaders, such
            as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil and Shahid Ashfaqallah
            Khan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1929</strong> - For some time, Singh had been exploiting the
            power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British,
            purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks
            about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a
            result of the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act
            to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims.
            Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed
            the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh's plan was to explode a bomb
            inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was
            to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute
            Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted
            by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was
            for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they
            could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause. The
            HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat's participation in
            the bombing because they were certain that his prior involvement in
            the Saunders shooting meant that his arrest would ultimately result
            in his execution. However, they eventually decided that he was their
            most suitable candidate. On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by
            Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its
            public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed
            not to kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the
            finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The
            smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt
            could probably have escaped in the confusion had they wished.
            Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long
            Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested
            and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1929</strong> - the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore
            and Saharanpur. On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was
            discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of
            HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal. Not long after
            this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the
            conspirators became informants. With the new information available,
            the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders
            murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture. Singh, Sukhdev,
            Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - On 2 July 1930, a habeas corpus petition was
            filed in the High Court challenging the ordinance on the grounds
            that it was ultra vires and, therefore, illegal; the Viceroy had no
            powers to shorten the customary process of determining justice. The
            petition argued that the Defence of India Act 1915 allowed the
            Viceroy to introduce an ordinance, and set up such a tribunal, only
            under conditions of a breakdown of law-and-order, which, it was
            claimed in this case, had not occurred. However, the petition was
            dismissed as being premature. Carden-Noad presented the government's
            charges of conducting robberies, and the illegal acquisition of arms
            and ammunition among others. The evidence of G. T. H. Hamilton
            Harding, the Lahore superintendent of police, shocked the court. He
            stated that he had filed the first information report against the
            accused under specific orders from the chief secretary to the
            governor of Punjab and that he was unaware of the details of the
            case. The prosecution depended mainly on the evidence of P. N.
            Ghosh, Hans Raj Vohra, and Jai Gopal who had been Singh's associates
            in the HSRA. On 10 July 1930, the tribunal decided to press charges
            against only 15 of the 18 accused and allowed their petitions to be
            taken up for hearing the next day. The trial ended on 30 September
            1930. The three accused, whose charges were withdrawn, included Dutt
            who had already been given a life sentence in the Assembly bomb
            case. The ordinance (and the tribunal) would lapse on 31 October
            1930 as it had not been passed by the Central Assembly or the
            British Parliament. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its
            300-page judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the
            participation of Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in Saunder's murder was
            proven. They were sentenced to death by hanging. Of the other
            accused, three were acquitted (Ajoy Ghosh, Jatindra Nath Sanyal and
            Des Raj), Kundan Lal received seven years' rigorous imprisonment,
            Prem Dutt received five years of the same, and the remaining seven
            (Kishori Lal, Mahabir Singh, Bijoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Verma, Gaya
            Prasad, Jai Dev and Kamalnath Tewari) were all sentenced to
            transportation for life.

          <li>
            <strong>1931</strong> - Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to
            death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24
            March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three
            were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is
            reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise
            Singh's hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised
            instead by an honorary judge, who also signed the three death
            warrants, as their original warrants had expired.The jail
            authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed
            the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of
            darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes
            into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore.

            "Let us see how steadfast I am. One of my friends asked me to pray.
            When informed of my atheism, he said, "When your last days come, you
            will begin to believe." I said, "No, dear sir, Never shall it
            happen. I consider it to be an act of degradation and
            demoralisation. For such petty selfish motives, I shall never pray."
            Reader and friends, is it vanity? If it is, I stand for it.
